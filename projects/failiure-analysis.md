While at ACI, I wrote an instructional and technical marketing guidebook called “Failure Analysis Techniques for Electronics.” 

I included case studies to illustrate many of the issues found in manufacturing, how to measure and confirm them, and how to prevent the issues from re-occurring.

The figure on the left summarizes many of the areas where failures can occur on and in an electronics component.

I’ve seen the majority of those firsthand, as well as process issues at:
* The component-level with 
 * Wafer-level fabrication and processing and 
 * Wire-bond processes
* The bare board-level with alignment of the layers and annular rings
 * Issues in the plating and dielectric layers and surface finish depositions and cleaning
 * The assembly-level with materials management, including the appropriate storage and drying of materials before reflow
 * Component placement
 * Reflow profiles and 
 * Cleaning and protection from the environment 
* And after assembly with 
 * ESD and EOS damage
 * Chemical and environmental contamination and 
 * Mechanical and thermal damage
