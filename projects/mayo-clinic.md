I joined the Mayo Clinic soon after earning my undergrad degree because I wanted to start building my career with a well-known institution.

Some of my technical accomplishments included:
- The compounds I made led to multiple publications for the molecular biology group’s primary investigators in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences and related journals. 
- I helped develop compounds involved in research for muscular and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.
- I learned a great deal about performing synthetic organic research and developing structure-activity or structure-property relationship studies.

The skills I used there included: 
- Synthetic organic chemistry
- Materials characterization using FTIR and NMR spectroscopy, polarimetry, and GC‑MS, HPLC, and TLC chromatographic methods
- Anatomy and Neurochemistry

I chose to leave because: 
- I wanted to earn a graduate degree and pivot my career towards materials for technology applications.
